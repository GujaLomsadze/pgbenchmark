Benchamark:
    ...


Threaded/Parallel Benchmark:
    ...


General Features:
    
    [1] GridSearch for best-performance DDL
        User provides possible options of table DDL and software
        Benchamrks each option provided from the list, returns best-fitting option of DDL
        Example:
            | index1.sql:
                    create index on ......
            | index2.sql
                    create index on ......
            | index3.sql
                    create index on ......

            benchmark tries:
                    1. index_1 * index_2 * index_3
                    2. index_1 * index_3
                    3. index_1 * index_2
                    4. index_3
                    5. index_2
                    6. index_1
            
            and after benchamrk -> gives ordered list of best options


        Requires:
            Feature to perform DDL change while maintaining initial state.
                yaml or whatever definition language to easily set it up
                    option 1: User definies .yml or something with different setups, providing sql files
                    option 2: With code -> Add N amount of variations for DDL

            Feature to insert dummy data into table. I prefer that user takes care of that by him/herself/itself but ... yeah
